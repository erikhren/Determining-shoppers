    "- How accurately are we able to predict that a customer is going to make an online purchase on a website?\n",
    "- What and what is the range of driving factors that lead to a purchase? \n",
    "- Can the probability of online purchase produced through data mining represent the \"real\" probability of customer online purchase?\n",
    "- Do those who purchase products tend to be of a certain region? returning or new visitor? buying near a special day, particular month or weekend? or spending more time on a specific page or click-thorugh (bounce) freuqently? What pages do they visit and time spent on them before exit?\n",

    "Online e-commerce applications are becoming a primary vehicle for people to find, compare, and ultimately purchase products. One of the fundamental questions that arises in e-commerce is to characterize, understand, and model user long-term purchasing intent, which is important as it allows for personalized and context relevant e-commerce services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding online purchase intent and its buildup over time is important because individuals spend large amounts of time and resources on online shopping—in the U.S. alone, e-commerce sales have reached over 350 billion USD per year and are expected to grow at around 15% annually. \n",

    "**Quick Facts**\n",
    "- 44% of online shoppers use their smartphone to shop more than any other device. Over half of consumers are doing their shopping online while simultaneously performing other tasks competing for their attention\n",
    "- Prices and shipping fees are the most important criteria influencing shopping decisions for more than 90% of respondents. Additionally, 77% cite shipping and other extra fees as the main reasons they would abandon their online shopping cart.\n",

    "**Past work**<br>\n",
    "Generally, most work on this topic has examined short-term user activity and considered predicting whether a given user session will result in a purchase. But its important to note that the purchase intent of a consumer may slowly build up over time, and may not instantaneously lead to a purchase. Furthermore, traditional studies often examine user behavior on a single e-commerce platform, while users may use several different services and move across e-commerce platforms when deciding which product to purchase and where. Thus, what is missing from the picture is a cross-platform analysis of how user purchase intent varies over time. To this end, it is important to contrast the population of purchasing users with the population of non- purchasing users, and then also identify how purchasers’ online behavior changes over time from the norm as a result of impending purchases.\n",
